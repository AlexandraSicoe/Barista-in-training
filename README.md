# Task Overview:

Greetings, Barista-in-training! Get ready to dive into the aromatic world of coffee. Your task involves brewing up some piping-hot JavaScript to manage a bustling coffee shop!

Your adventure takes place with the `coffeeShopData.json` file, a digital logbook containing an array of coffee orders. This data is the secret ingredient to brewing success in your JavaScript coffee shop.

Every coffee artist needs their tools, and yours is the `coffeeFunctions.js` file. This helper will aid you in your daily grind with a variety of functions. Your mission is to implement these functions and solve the barista tasks at hand.

## Part 1: Preparation

Create a JSON file named `coffeeShopData.json` with an array of objects. Each object represents a coffee order with the following properties:

**orderID**: The unique ID of the order (string)
**customerName**: The name of the customer (string)
**coffeeType**: The type of coffee ordered (string)
**extras**: An array of extras added to the coffee (array of strings)
**price**: The price of the coffee (number)
Create an `index.js` file. This is your digital barista station where you will use your utility functions to manage coffee orders.

Create a `coffeeFunctions.js` file. This is your coffee toolkit, containing all the functions needed for your barista tasks.

## Part 2: Tasks

All these tasks need to be done by calling functions from the `coffeeFunctions.js` file in your `index.js` file.

**First-time customer**: Find out if a customer has ordered before. Can you tell if "John" is a first-time customer?

**Tall order**: Find all orders with more than three extras. Who are these flavor enthusiasts?

**Favorite brew**: Determine the most ordered type of coffee. What's the house favorite?

**Total earnings**: Calculate the total earnings from all coffee orders. How much has your coffee shop earned today?

**Best customers**: Find the top 3 customers who have made the most orders. Who are your regulars?

**Coffee express**: Add a rush order to the front of the order queue. Can you prioritize "Jane's" Cappuccino with almond milk?

**Order up**: Remove the first order in the queue once it's done. Who gets their coffee next?

**Pricey palette**: Find the most expensive coffee order made. Which order had the highest price tag?

**Happy hour**: Apply a 20% discount to all coffee orders. What's the new total earnings for the day?

**Custom orders**: Add a custom coffee type and its price to each order for a customer. Can you add a "Caramel Macchiato for \$5" to all orders made by "Alex"?

## Note:

Brewing the perfect cup of JavaScript isn't easy. Remember, array methods like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and `sort` are your trusty coffee spoons, helping you stir through each task. Good luck and happy coding!
